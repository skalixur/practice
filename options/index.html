    So, what is this?
    It's a dead simple counter to help me practice piano. I've been playing piano for a couple years, and whenever
    practicing, I try to play each measure correctly at least seven times in a row before moving onto the next one.
    Before creating this website, I used a dice to keep track of my progress, but I've since lost it!

    My solution to that is this website. Here's the functionality included:
  <ul>
    <li>Tap in the bottom half of the screen to increment the counter by one</li>
    <li>Tap in the top half to reset it to zero</li>
    <li>A motivational message, once you get to seven (or a success threshold of your choosing)</li>
    <li>A customizable success threshold to choose the difficulty of practice</li>
    <li>Mobile compatibility (because I'm not putting a computer on the piano, please!</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <script>
    const successThresholdInput = document.getElementById('success-threshold');
    const successThreshold = localStorage.getItem('successThreshold') || 7;
    successThresholdInput.value = successThreshold;
    successThresholdInput.addEventListener('input', () => {
      const value = parseInt(successThresholdInput.value, 10);
      if (isNaN(value) || value <= 0) {
        alert('Please enter a valid positive number.');
        return;
      }
      localStorage.setItem('successThreshold', value);
    });
  </script>
</body>
