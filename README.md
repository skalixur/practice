 So, what is this?

It's a dead simple counter to help me practice piano. I've been playing piano for a couple years, and whenever practicing, I try to play each measure correctly at least seven times in a row before moving onto the next one.
 Before creating this website, I used a dice to keep track of my progress, but I've since lost it!

 My solution to that is this website. Here's the functionality included:

- Tap in the bottom half of the screen to increment the counter by one
- Tap in the top half to reset it to zero
- A motivational message, once you get to seven (or a success threshold of your choosing)
- A customizable success threshold to choose the difficulty of practice
- Mobile compatibility (because I'm not putting a computer on the piano, please!
